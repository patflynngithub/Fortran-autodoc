## Doxygen notes

### Attempt 1

- Copy over *ford/src* directory contents to *doxygen/src* (*.F90, *.inc, Makefile)
  - used earlier, less complicated version of the *ford/src* code
- Generate Doxygen settings file (Doxyfile)
  - doxygen -g   (in *doxygen/* directory)
- Modify Doxyfile
  - INPUT                  = src
  - OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = doc
  - OPTIMIZE_FOR_FORTRAN   = YES
- Run doxygen
  - doxygen
  
RESULT:  Blank HTML documentation

### Attempt 2

- Further modify Doxyfile
  - add *.F90 to FILE_PATTERNS setting
  - EXTENSION_MAPPING      = F90=FortranFree

RESULT: generated HTML documentation, but ...
- warnings about *a_mod.F90* module variables not being documented
  - they show up anyway in HTML doc (maybe warning is referencing lack of autodoc comment)
- warnings about *kinds_mod.F90* module variables not being documented
  - they show up anyway in HTML doc (maybe warning is referencing lack of autodoc comment)
- warnings about *types_mod.F90* module variables not being documented
  - they show up anyway in HTML doc (maybe warning is referencing lack of autodoc comment)
- *classes_mod* HTML doc missing some type definitions (does contain *int_class_t* entry but its interface information is not displayed)
  - int_class_extended_t
  - real_class_t
  - real_class_extended_t

### Attempt 3

- Modify *doxygen/src/real_class_submod.F90* to redeclare the interface declarations done in *doxygen/src/class_mod.F90*. (maybe this will cause the *real_class_t* type definition to show in the HTML documentation)

RESULT: no difference

### Attempt 4

- Rename *.F90 files to *.f08
  - had to modify Makefile to add *-cpp* option to *gfortran* to make compilation work (the lowercase *f* in *.fo8* causes *gfortran* to not use the preprocessor before compilation)

RESULT: no difference

## Conclusion

- THUMBS DOWN!
  - Might be able to fix some of the above errors by tinkering around with *Doxyfile* settings and our *doxygen/src* Fortran file structures (external/internal), but I think the module/submodule problems in *classes_mod.F90* are endemic to the current version of *doxygen* (v.1.9.6) and can't be fixed without *doxygen*'s code itself being improved
